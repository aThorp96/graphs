# Graphs 
graphs is a graph package for working with graph problems and algorithms. Currently it is an implimentation of an undirected, unweighted graph. Weight and direction functionality to come. 

Original implemented by Dr. Alice McRae, I ported to Go for my own studies. Pull requests accepted.


#TODO
- Add support for directional edges
- Add bounds checking on vertex entries
